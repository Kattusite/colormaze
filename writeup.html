<a name='Goal'></a><h1>Goal</h1>
Inspired by some of the work we have been doing towards the latter half of this course, as well as the role-playing action-adventure games of our past, we decided to design the initial levels of a game. We also wanted the game to emulate (to a certain extent) the process of creating a video game - from a basic 2D design, to the initial colorization, to the addition of a third dimension. This formed our desire to create a 'meta' role-playing game of sorts, where the user's objectives of are to essentially better their experence of the game itself. With each 'objective' completed, an element of the game improves, thereby mimicking a part of the game development process. <br><br>

As with most video games, Color Maze is beneficial for any user looking to find a way to relax and have a fun, enjoyable experience. In addition, we created it with the hopes that the user also learns a little bit more about the bottom-up game design and development process. Ideally, with each improvement the user unlocks, they feel a similar level of satisfaction to how we felt adding each feature ourselves!<br>

<br><a name='PreviousWork'></a><h1>Previous Work</h1>
This project is inspired by a lot of the first generation games that we have been exposed to, from the user experience of the 2D Mario games, to the level design of Pacman. We realized that the best of these games made efficient use of a minimalistic design, with a simple set-up and clear objectives, whereas some of our less-prefered games had a user experience that was bogged down by unneccessary features and over-complicated plots. Something about Evoland here as well.


<br><br><a name='Approach'></a><h1>Approach</h1>s
- Approach to user experience i.e. have them collect objectives in any order they want, each one improving game<br>
- High level approach i.e. order of implementations + why we think it works well<br>
- Specific approaches i.e. what languages/methods we used for our implementations (explanded upon in the methodology section) + when each of them work, why they work

<br><p><hr><p><a name='Methodology'></a><h1><Big>Methodology</Big></h1><p><hr><p>

<a name='ImplementationChosen'></a><h1>Implementation Chosen</h1>

We can divide this section by features. <br>

Features:<br>

- Movable character<br>
- Physics? (i.e. collisions with walls, projectiles, 'doors' - idk if this is good enough to count as physics or not)<br>
- Health features (pulsing, getting hit by projectiles)<br>
- RGB, 2-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit colorization<br>
- 3d camera<br>
- Particle trail effect<br>

<br><a name='Challenges'></a><h1>Challenges</h1>

We can describe 2 big challenges here, and a couple of smaller ones. We can also include what we decided NOT to implement and why.

<br><p><hr><p><a name='Results'></a><h1><Big>Results</Big></h1><p><hr><p>

<a name='MeasuringSuccess'></a><h1>Measuring Success</h1>

- Our own visual tests <br>
- Our own playthrough tests<br>
- Feedback from test users<br>

<br><a name='Outcomes'></a><h1>Outcomes</h1>

<br><p><hr><p><a name='Discussion'></a><h1><Big>Discussion</Big></h1><p><hr><p>
